I am a postdoctoral researcher in the  Machine Learning Department at [CMU](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/), working with [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering (ECSE), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/)), advised by [Ali Tajer](https://www.isg-rpi.com/). My research was supported by an [IBM AI Horizons PhD Fellowship](https://fcrc.rpi.edu/).



<!-- I develop the statistical and algorithmic foundations needed to answer this question from the perspective of causality and identifiability, in particular *causal representation learning*.  -->

I broadly work at the intersection of machine learning and causality. At its core, my work is driven by the question:
**_What is the right foundation for learning reliable representations of complex data?_** 
I develop the statistical and algorithmic foundations needed to answer this question, with emphasis on learning **identifiable** and **causal** mechanisms behind the data, particularly through **Causal Representation Learning**.
I am especially keen on leveraging shared mechanisms across diverse environments to establish scalable and provably correct algorithms---a common theme in my broader research directions on **Causal Discovery** and **Sequential Intervention Design** problems. I am also interested in increasing the efficiency and extent of **identifiability** in common representation learning paradigms (e.g., contrastive and noncontrastive).

<!-- 
1. **Identifiable** — the object of learning is well-defined and unique (up to simple equivalences), and  
2. **Causal** — representation captures cause–effect relations and supports reasoning about interventions. -->
