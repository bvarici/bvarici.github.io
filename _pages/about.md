I am a postdoctoral researcher in the  Machine Learning Department at [CMU](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/), working with [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering (ECSE), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/)), advised by [Ali Tajer](https://www.isg-rpi.com/). My research was supported by an [IBM AI Horizons PhD Fellowship](https://fcrc.rpi.edu/).



<!-- I develop the statistical and algorithmic foundations needed to answer this question from the perspective of causality and identifiability, in particular *causal representation learning*.  -->

I broadly work at the intersection of machine learning and causality. At its core, my work is driven by the question:
**_What is the right foundation for learning reliable representations of complex data?_** 
I develop the statistical and algorithmic foundations needed to answer this question, with emphasis on learning **identifiable** and **causal** mechanisms behind the data, particularly through [Causal Representation Learning](projects/CRL2)[[1](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume26/24-0194/24-0194.pdf),[2](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/varici24a/varici24a.pdf),[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05937),[4](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XL9aaXl0u6),[5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20884)].
I am especially keen on leveraging shared mechanisms across diverse environments to establish scalable and provably correct algorithms---a common theme in my broader research directions on *Causal Discovery*[[6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08666),[7](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ALRWXT1RLZ),[8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07512),[9](https://bvarici.github.io/assets/pdf/Varici2022-UAI.pdf)] and *Sequential Intervention Design*[[10](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume24/22-0969/22-0969.pdf),[11](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19794)] problems. I am also interested in increasing the efficiency and extent of **identifiability** in common representation learning paradigms[[12](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=4GZwFPzLgW),[13](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24672)].
