I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/). 

Previously, I recently obtained my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering (ECSE), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/)), advised by [Ali Tajer](https://www.isg-rpi.com/). I was also an [IBM AI Horizons Scholar](https://airc.rpi.edu/aih-scholars) and worked closely with a number of collaborators, including [Karthikeyan Shanmugam](https://sites.google.com/a/utexas.edu/karthiksh/) and [Prasanna Sattigeri](https://pronics2004.github.io/). 

My research interests are centered on causal inference from interventions. During my Ph.D., I have focused on leveraging the shared causal mechanisms and the role of interventions across different data environments. Specifically, I have been developing methodology for causal representation learning, sequential intervention design, and causal structure learning.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
