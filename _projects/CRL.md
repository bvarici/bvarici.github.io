The manuscript with extended results and blog post are coming soon.

See below for the current two papers:

**Score-based Causal Representation Learning with Interventions** focuses on a linear transform from latent variables to observed variables. (add details, one hard/soft node)

**General Identifiability and Achievability for Causal Representation Learning** focuses on a general nonparametric transform from latent variables to observed variables. (add details, two hard per node). It is the extended version of the CRL@NeurIPS2023 Oral paper *Score-based Causal Representation Learning with Interventions: Nonparametric Identifiability*.
